# **Weekly Newsletter June 28 - July 2, 2021**

Happy Monday Everyone!

I hope you all had a great weekend and are looking forward to Canada Day. I know I am looking forward to taking a little time off and spending it with the family.

I do want to let everyone know this week's newsletter will be a little bit shorter and not to be shy if I've missed something.

##  Goodbye Amar 

It's with a heavy heart that I have to inform you all that Amar gave us his 2 weeks notice. Amar has been with us for nearly 3 years and during that time - he's grown to be someone who is always looking for the next challenge, pushing himself get better at everything he did and elevated all of us. Amar has been crucial to the success of iCBT as the primary UI Developer and has also helped to keep Manage and Connect looking good and working smoothly.

While it's sad to see Amar go - I am thrilled for him and his next adventure. I have no doubt he'll go on to do some amazing work and have a positive impact on those he'll work with - just as he had with all of us.

Amar's last day will be on Tuesday, July 6th. I'll be sending out an invite for his going away party where we'll play some games and have some fun to see him off. If you have ideas for games - let me know.

## Glint Survey Results 

The Glint Survey Results came in last week and I owe all of you a big thank you. Our score has managed to climb to 85 - which is the highest I've seen it since I've had access to the results. We'll review the scores in more detail on our joint call tomorrow but a couple things I wanted to highlight.

The three strengths highlighted were Recognition, Action Taking and Prospects - which is great. Recognition and Action Taking were both areas of opportunity when we first starting doing these survey's - so it's great to see that you folks have felt progress has been made in these categories.

Areas of Opportunities highlighted are in Collaboration, Well-Being and Empowerment. While I'll be going over the report in more detail tomorrow, if there are any ideas of suggestions that could help improve these three areas - Please don't hesitate to let me know. That also extends to any concerns or issues that I didn't mention but you are still worried about.

## Canada Day  

Thursday is Canada Day which is a Sat Holiday. I know there's quite a few of you who are planning to take the day off but I encourage anyone else who might be thinking about it - to for for it. It's a perfect opportunity for an extended long week without taking a big hit to your schedule.

Please let me know if you'd like to take the day off.

## **Featured Project - myFinances**

myFinances is a financial literacy platform that helps you achieve your financial wellbeing. This project aims to address feelings of stress, anxiety and overall concerns many Canadians have about their personal finances.

As a new initiative from retirement solutions, we started as a small yet ambitious team working against the clock to release an MVP. While we were in the process of scaling the team up, everyone helped out in anyway possible. As the UI was being built out, the design team worked closely with QA and created visual defect umbrellaâ€™s which logged UI bugs, and included details for the solution. This helped us to size, prioritize and fix the issues, and alievated some work for the QA resource, allowing her to focus on testing functionality. It was really important that the team worked together and communicated effectively to get the job done.

myFinances is still at the beginning of the product roadmap, and has an amazing team who is eager to continue to evolve the product forward. Keep an eye out for future releases and watch myFinances evolve.

## Andrew's Thoughts

As we go into the summer, I am hoping to be able to throw a get together with the team up at my place. This was something that we had talked about last year but due to the risks involved with COVID, it just wasn't safe to do. This summer will be a little different as many of us will have had our second vaccine.

I will need to connect with a few folks in HR and make sure we'll be cleared to get together but I am hoping due to the fact we would all be outside and vaccinated - that this is something we'll be able to do.

We've had a few folks join us like Jon, Ron, Lynn and Goli that we've yet to meet. It'd be great to be able to meet up, run a workshop for work purposes (of course) and enjoy some time together safely. 

I will keep you all updated on this as I try to work through the various challenges or concerns that will no doubt arise. If this is something you're not comfortable with - feel free to let me know privately and I'll make sure you don't feel any pressure to join... assuming we are even able to do this.

Cheers,  
Andrew
