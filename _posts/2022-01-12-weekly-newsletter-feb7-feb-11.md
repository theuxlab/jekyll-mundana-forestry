# **Weekly Newsletter Jan 4th - Jan 7th, 2022**

Happy Monday Everyone! I hope everyone enjoyed their weekend. It’s starting to get busy and new initiatives are starting to become clearer. With that said - here’s a few updates for folks.

##  Introducing Gather 

Gather is a digital office that allows folks to actually see and interact with each other as if we were in the office. I had the chance to share this experience with a handful of folks from the design team on Friday and was the closest thing to real office interactions I’ve experienced since we all went remote. 

I encourage all of you to join (there’s even a desktop app) and explore the space. There’s desks for folks to sit at when working, social areas for when you’re in the mood to chat, meeting rooms for private conversations and more to explore. 

It’d be great to see folks join in the morning and set up at a desk. I’ll be taking Rajiv around with the intention of introducing him to the team and I’m hopeful to do so with everyone. 

The UK and Canadian teams have been invited and my hope is that as we settle into the new tool it’ll encourage deeper collaboration, communication and a deeper sense of belonging with the design org. 

## Feature Teams are changing

Last week was unexpected as there were a few changes that occurred due to NOMI and an introduction of Feature Team pods. As a result - some of the feature team assignments have changed and are continuing to change. 

Jon and I will be releasing an updated list of teams and who’s been assigned once we’ve got a better sense of how things will land. I’m hoping that’ll be by the end of the week. 

It looks as though we may need to hire multiple new designers to fill the needs that now exist with these teams. As we get more information - we’ll be sure to share it with the group. 


## Timesheets are Due

Please make sure to get your time in for January ASAP. This is important to get as it impacts how we budget for 2022 and what we’ll be able to do in terms of assistance for the team. 

## **Upcoming Vacations**

If you don't see your name listed - please be sure to add the time to WorkDay as I'll be pulling this time off from there moving forward.

## Andrew's Thoughts

There’s two things I wanted to touch on today. The first was a quick update on the QBR meetings. The meeting went well and Kaytek was happy with the progress we’ve made as a team. I’ll post the deck in teams for anyone who is curious as to what we presented. Other than that - there wasn’t much that was notable to come out of the latest QBR meeting. We’ve got another one this week where we’ll learn more about NOMI and the greenhouse initiative which I expect will result in some notable need so I’ll be sure to share any updates as they become available. 

The second thing was that I wanted to circle back and share my experiences with Gather. Nick initially sent it to me a little over a week ago as something that could benefit the team and I when I first looked at it - I didn’t really “get it”. I set it aside with a goal of revisiting it in more detail when I had a chance. On Friday - I set 15 minutes aside to take a closer look and sign up for the platform. 

It was at that point - I started to understand why this could be beneficial and why Nick had sent it to me. As the day progressed - I left it open in the background and proceeded to invite more people as a trial before eventually inviting everyone. 

On Friday I had the chance to connect with more folks than I had in weeks - even though in many cases it was just a quick conversation. I was able to connect with folks who had quick questions and at the end of the day went around to those sitting at desks to say have a nice weekend.

It was a great experience and I’m looking forward to seeing what happens when we all start using it as I really believe this has a chance to foster a sense of connection amongst our group that’s been lacking ever since the pandemic happened. 

Hopefully I’ll get to see you all in there and that you all have a great week. 

Cheers,  
Andrew
