# **Weekly Newsletter Jan 4th - Jan 7th, 2022**

It’s a new year - 2022 and there’s a lot of exciting things set to happen this year. The first big change is we’ve now merged with the IHS Design Team to form a new Enterprise Product Design Team that now supports every product offered by LifeWorks. This is an exciting time and will eventually lead to more opportunities for the entire product team.

##  Goli, Diana and Ksenia are now all FTE 

I thought I’d start the new year off with some great news. Over the last couple of months we’ve been working with the finance team to convert some of our long-standing contractors to full time. We started the process back in October when we converted Ksenia and I can finally announce that we’ve now converted Goli and Diana as well. Please take a moment to congratulate them on joining the team permanently.

## Abstract Notebooks Bought and Closed 

In a surprising turn of events - over the holiday - I received an email from Abstract to let me know that Abstract Notebooks was bought by Adobe and was shut down effective immediately. I think Adobe is planning on re-releasing it but I doubt it’ll have the Figma integrations that we’ve come to enjoy.

I’ll be pulling the data from the Abstract this week and we’ll figure out a solution. I’ve spent some time working on a potential solution over the holiday but nothing is ready for a reveal yet. I may need to reach out to some folks for some support. If there’s any features you wanted to see in Abstract that didn’t exist - let me know as there will be opportunities to fit it in.

## Finalizing Product Teams for 2022

We are looking to finalize the new product teams for 2022 and it’s looking like there will be 22 teams in total that we’ll be supporting for the entire Product Design Organization. Some of the teams will be seeing multiple designers added to them where others may see a single designer added at a reduced capacity. This will become clearer over the coming days as we get the details confirmed. These product teams will be responsible for multiple initiatives over the year and the hope is that this new approach will encourage a more effective way of working together.

As soon as we’ve been given the green light - I’ll start reaching out and letting folks know what teams they’ll be on for the year.

This, in addition to merger with the IHS Design Team, will be leading to changes in how the overall product design organization will be structured. I’m currently working with Jimsy and Jon to ensure that the new structure will work for everyone involved. I think we’ve got the structure finalized and will announce it once we get confirmation on the Product Teams to ensure no last minute changes will be required.

## New Hire for Bell Work

We have started the process for hiring a new product designer on a contract basis to support the upcoming Bell Work required for DC Frontier. This new designer will be coming in to help the DC Frontier Team focus on building out a solution that works for Bell as they transition away from MyLife 1.5 and towards MyLife 2.0. While there’s a separate initiative set to occur for Bell and MyLife - this initiative will be exclusive to the DC Frontier Platform.

The hope is to have this new designer start work before the end of the month so that we can hit the deadlines we’ve set. I will keep folks in the loop once we have made a hiring decision. We are hoping to start interviews this week to try and get someone in ASAP. If you have any recommendations - please don’t hesitate to reach out and share their name and portfolio. 

## Timesheet Reminder for December

A quick reminder to anyone who has yet to do their timesheets yet to please enter their time into WorkDay for the month of December ASAP. If you have any questions - just let me know.

## **Upcoming Vacations**

## Andrew's Thoughts

I debated making this a story above but wanted to take some extra time to speak to the return of lockdowns in Canada. I know those of us with kids were likely surprised yesterday when the government announced a return return to virtual learning after initially being told that schools would reopen this Thursday. It didn’t give folks much time to prepare to make adjustments and if your household was anything like ours - it caused panic and repeatedly asking the question “How are we going to do this?”

For others - it might mean the news and media has gotten overwhelming or the idea of being stuck at home again with no where to go or no one to see can feel depressing. I want to make it clear that anyone who needs to talk, needs support, has to change their schedule or is feeling overwhelmed by everything - please don’t hesitate to reach out. I am here for each of you and we will figure out a solution that works while we deal with the latest round of lockdowns.

Lastly I wanted to remind folks that one of the perks of working at LifeWorks is that we have access to EAP services and tools like iCBT. If you’re struggling with the latest lockdown, the holidays (either the stress of experiencing them or the disappointment of not celebrating them as usual), the stress of trying to balance work and life right now - it’s important to remember you have a variety of options available through LifeWorks. No one here (myself included) would know you’re leveraging these resources as it’s all private and confidential. I’m happy to walk any of you through what’s available if you need it or you can check it out by visiting the iCBT or WorkHealthLife sites.

That said - I can’t wait to see what amazing stuff we do for 2022 and I am fortunately thankful that I’ll get to spend another year working with all of you incredible people.

Cheers,  
Andrew
