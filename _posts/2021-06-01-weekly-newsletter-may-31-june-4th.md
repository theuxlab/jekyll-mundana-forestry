# **Weekly Newsletter May 31 - June 4, 2021**

We are officially in the month of June - how exciting is that? The province is slowly starting it's path to reopening and the days are warm, long and sunny. On Sunday I was helping to rebuild part of our floating docks and the time flew by. I was shocked to learn it was 7:00pm when we came in from working all day. I thought it was closer to 5pm - the power of beautiful, sunny days. The time flies by faster than expected.

Although I will admit I also lived up to the nickname that Nick coined last year - Milhouse. I had a nasty allergic reaction to the wood we were working with. What are the odds? haha

##  Updating CDS Documentation üé®

As part of the ongoing need for design system governace as well as clients asking to see the documentation for CDS - we've been starting to take the documentation from Figma and putting it into ZeroHeight. So far we've managed to get a fair amount transfered over and that effort will continue to occur over the next few days and weeks.

The updated documentation includes the latest changes as a result of the rebrand. Once the foundation of documentation is in place which outlines what components are available for usage and how to use it - we'll be adding code support and connecting to Storybook. The code support will be a combination of React Components and Web Components.

As we work on the new Navigate platform - a React library was provided to the team from the Abiliti team. The Navigate is currently looking into what needs to be done to adjust, such as updating to reflect the new brand, but overall this development will help us rollout support quicker. I'll be providing links to some the front end development team to take a look to further evaluate the work that's been done. I still want to move forward with Web Components but if we have a library that help today - we can leverage it to help teams faster and potentially use it to build up the web components.

## Interviewing for EAS ü§ù

We have started to look at candiates for a full time position on the EAS team. This new hire will be to fill the void left by √âlise and Niem's depatures.  This position is being offered by the EAS team and so whoever we hire won't formally report into me. Instead - it'll be a similar dynamic to how we work with Jos√©e and √âlise. The new hire will work with us, continue using our processes, structures and design systems but ultimately will be considered a business resource for the EAS Group.

This position will be for Montreal - and due to the reporting dynamics none of our contractors are eligble for converting to fill the role. This was something we discussed at the executive level before deciding to go in the direction we're moving in. I should have an interview with a potential candidate this week and will keep folks updated as we progress through this process.

## Senior Leadership Team (SLT) Call this week  üóìÔ∏è

Every month the Senior Leadership Team in the IT groups to discuss the prior month to discuss issues related to budgets, work, performance and HR needs. This call is scheduled for Wednesday of this week. We should be able to see the latest about how the IT group is performing overall and there's potential for additional return to work details. I'll be sure to keep everyone updated on any important developments that come out of this call. 

## Weekly Vaccines Reminder üò∑

At this point - I think most are aware of our vaccine policies but I wanted to leave this in the newsletter for one more week just in case someone hasn't seen it yet. You've got up to 3 hours to get the vaccine as per LifeWorks policies. That said - if you need more time or need some support covering work while getting your vaccine - please reach out. We can work together to come up with a plan to make sure you don't miss your opportunity to get vaccinated.

You can [see the full policy here](https://msoit.sharepoint.com/sites/Panorama/SitePages/Paid-time-off-for-employees-to-receive-COVID-19-vaccine.aspx?from=SendByEmail&e=QUvoN5oiT0CwlFvcFbAgYQ&at=9).

Unfortunately the dream is over already. After taking a commanding 3-1 series lead - my Maple Leafs choked again and lost the series to Montreal. This will be my last Leafs update for the next several months. I was hoping to keep this updates running a little longer but such is life.

Now I'll be sitting in a corner questioning my belief in this team. üòâ

## Andrew's Thoughts

I mentioned this in my newsletter last week but wanted to take a few minutes to further highlight the need to take time off as summer is now here. An important part of avoiding burnout is taking time off before we reach a point where burnout feels enivible. I can speak from personal experience on how important it is not to wait until it's too late.

Last year I was supposed to take some time off in March to travel to Costa Rica a week and half. This would have been my first week long vacation in nearly a year. When the pandemic hit - instead of taking the week off anyways to recharge - I cancelled the vacation time. I figured I would just use my vacation time later in the year once we had a better idea of what vacationing in a COVID world might look like. At the start of June came around - Frans asked if I had plans to take any time off over the summer. I told him I wasn't sure but didn't think so - we weren't going anywhere and there was no plans to have family visit - so I couldn't see a reason to take time off. At this point - I was starting to see some of the early signs of burnout but figured a lighter summer would let me avoid it.

By mid-July - I realized that wasn't going to help and took a week off with little notice (which I hate doing). As I'm sure most of you remember - my August wasn't exactly smooth but the lack of time off and self-care made everything worse. I thought taking a week off would be enough to fight off the burnout but I was too late. Had I listened to Frans and taken some time off earlier to rest - I may have been better equipped to handle the stress and pressures that came in August, September and October. It's not only important to take the time off but to also be able to look forward to it. Knowing you've got some time to rest and relax coming up - helps make it easier to deal with the noise around you.

This year - I've already told Mike I plan on taking some time off this summer. While I don't know what week it'll be - I'm already looking forward to the time off. I share this because I haven't heard from too many of you about your plans this summer and despite we're still dealing with COVID - I want to encourage folks to take some time for themselves. In the end - it wasn't until the new year did I feel like I was starting to come out of my funk and that brought it's own set of stresses.

What we do is important - but it's not so important that you feel you need to sacrifice mental or physical health. So please make sure to take some time over the summer to relax and reset. You all have earned it and deserve it.

Cheers,  
Andrew
