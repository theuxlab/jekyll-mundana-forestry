# **Weekly Newsletter May 17 - May 21, 2021**

Happy Tuesday everyone! Hopefully you all are excited for the long weekend coming up. I know I'm looking forward to enjoying the time outside. You all have been working so hard - I encourage you all to find some time to rest and reset as we kick off the summer.

## We are now LifeWorks

The rebrand has officially been announced and we no longer work for Morneau Shepell. I'm sure for some of you, it'll take a bit of an adjustment but these are exciting times we're in.

Tiphaine will be working on updating CDS to reflect the latest changes to the brand. She's already launched the new colours and will be working to provide additional updates over the coming weeks.

As Tiphaine mentioned in her release notes - we've left the old colours in for now as not everyone is updating colours right away. The decision to update colours will be unique to each project and should be the call of the product owners.

I know some of you are worried about the brand and the accessibility concerns that come along with it. This is something I've been flagging and there's been some adjustments along the way.

## Update from Kaytek Meeting

The meeting with Kaytek went well. In the end - we ended up focusing on four main topics.

1\. A formal introduction of Jon Darke

2\. Reviewing our capacity/resourcing concerns

3\. Reviewing level 3 maturity

4\. Reviewing our design debt strategy

The meeting went well with Kaytek pleased with the progress we've all made. He's happy to see us working with the different groups at LifeWorks. He also encouraged us to continue to build up our relationships across all the lines of business.

He also wanted to continue to encourage us to track our time to see where it goes. This will help give us a sense of where our efforts go to and what small jobs come up and take focus away.

This feedback was relevant as we talked about design debt. Knowing where we spend our time will make it easier to find the time/resources to support various tasks.

In the end - he was thrilled with where we're at and is excited to see what comes next for our group.

## New Employee Experience being worked on by the London Design Team

One interesting peice of information that came out last week was that the London Design Team is working on a new employee experience. Jeremey Everson was the first to reference it and after some digging - we were able to confirm it.

There will be some concern that the London team is about to jump CDS in terms of design. This is not the case and with the rebrand - it should bring the LifeWorks Design System and Consistency Design System closer together.

The notable differences are mostly tied to how colour is used and the style of illustrations being leveraged. These two things are areas where, thanks to the rebrand, we'll become more closely aligned.

We'll also be starting to share font structures to help make the two systems feel further aligned.

You can view the latest designs in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/zEaxpEjfeMQvw6iXa7BjAm/Ally-V2?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1%3A6447&scaling=min-zoom).

## Vaccines

As mentioned in teams, if you need to take time off to get your vaccine - that's not a problem at all. You can get up to 3 hours off to get your vaccine as per LifeWorks policies.

Once booked - let me know if you need any support covering meetings or deliverables. We'll work with you to make sure that you don't need to miss your appointment.

You can [see the full policy here](https://msoit.sharepoint.com/sites/Panorama/SitePages/Paid-time-off-for-employees-to-receive-COVID-19-vaccine.aspx?from=SendByEmail&e=QUvoN5oiT0CwlFvcFbAgYQ&at=9).

## Go Leafs Go!

In what is arguably the most important item of news this week - the Toronto Maple Leafs start the playoffs on Thursday. They'll be facing the Montreal Canadiens for the first time since 1979.

Needless to say - you can expect my emotional state to be a rollar coaster over the coming weeks. If you're a Habs fan - I apologize now as I fear we've become mortal enemies until the series is over.

In all seriousness though - The Leafs are going all the way to the Stanely Cup this year and I recommend getting onboard the fairweather fan train early. ;-)

## Andrew's Thoughts

I wanted to take a few minutes to speak to the rebrand to LifeWorks and our role with it. I know many of you have seen the new marketing site and aren't too impressed. I share your lack of enthusiasm in what is released. However I challenge each of you to look beyond what's we've seen so far.

The new LifeWork's brand has the potential to be something amazing. We shouldn't look at the marketing site or early release materials to set the standard. The brand is new and they needed to design a solution while dealing with frequent changes and demands. I think we'd all struggle in that scenario.

Instead, I challenge you to remember that at LifeWorks - we are now a product company. Our brand is established via the high quality products we help create and the people we're able to help.

A product designers, we are in the position to define how Users, Clients and Competitors view LifeWorks. The decisions we make and the standards we set - will be how this brand is ultimately received.

This is an opportunity for us to show the company and the world that we are a premium design organization. The rebrand has given us the tools we need to achieve this vision - and now it's up to use to show how best to use these tools.

I can't wait to see what amazing work you all come up with it.

Cheers,  
Andrew
