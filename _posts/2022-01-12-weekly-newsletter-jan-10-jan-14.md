# **Weekly Newsletter Jan 4th - Jan 7th, 2022**

Happy Wednesday Everyone! Hopefully everyones week is off to a good start. This will be a shorter newsletter as there isn’t too many new updates from last week. I anticipate this will change over the next couple weeks as January swings into full effect.

##  Introduction to the Product Department 

I had a meeting today with the leadership group for the Product Department - which we now report into. This initial meeting was a kick off for 2022 but there was some fascinating information that came out of it. As you all know - last year we introduced the concept of Total Wellbeing and the pillars of Mental, Physical, Financial and Social Health. Over the last couple of months we’ve been working with an outside consultant company called BCG who have been analyzing our services,  the marketplace and the best ways to grow as a company.

The overall takeaway was that mental health products are the biggest area of opportunity currently and given our status as an EAP provider - we’re uniquely positioned in the marketplace to be an industry leader for mental health. As a result there will be a new initiative starting this year called NOMI - which comes with a 30 million annual investment from our board.  We’ll be looking at our products like Nurture, Navigate and Connect to be the foundation for this mental health support. As these meetings progress - I’ll be able to provide more details as to what will be involved for NOMI but the exciting part is that it means we’re all becoming one big team. It’ll no longer be a situation where we feel like we’re working “with” business or where engineering is working “with” operations.  Instead - it’ll be all one team with design, business, engineering and operations working together towards a set of shared, high level OKR’s and KPI’s.

In the past - we’ve been bogged down by different goals depending on the department. It might be that design was told our goal was to present the best user experience, engineering was told they needed to deliver solutions as quick as possible, business needs to hit certain revenue targets and operations would need to meet specific service delivery times. 

In theory - all of these goals should overlap but that hasn’t always been the case. We’ve seen the user experience get sacrificed because of time constraints, features cut from development because of budget concerns or new solutions from IT be under utilized because of initial tests saw a slight uptick in initial delivery times.

Moving forward - all departments will be working towards the same set of goals and objects. So, for example, if a user experience isn’t strong enough or our delivery times get worse - than everyone from design to operations will be held accountable. This new way of approaching goals and objectives should help us break down walls and foster further unity between groups.

The goals are still being worked on and I will share them once they become available. Some early objectives that I have seen include Increasing Platform Engagement by 20%, hitting CapEx and OpEx budgets, and involvement in the new Greenhouse Initiatives.


In additional these new goals - we’ll be getting together as a group to set some goals and objectives for the design department as well. We’re still working on some of the details and need to know the higher level objectives first before we can define our own. If folks have any questions about what has been shared so far - please don’t hesitate to reach out. There’s limited details still but I expect it get further fleshed out over the coming days and weeks.

## 2021 Q4 Meetings Starting Soon

We will be starting the QBR meetings again shortly with the first of multiple meetings set to start next week. As always - I may need to reach out to some of you for help or support depending on how things go. We’ll be presenting our plans for 2022 as well - so I’ll be sure to share what we present so everyone is aware of the plans.
 I also expect to get ideas of what the other LOBs and technology domains have in store for 2022 and will be sure to share any relevant information.


## Hiring Updates

So a quick update - we’ve received close to a dozen applications so far for the contractor position role required for DC Frontier. We’ve extended an offer to one individual however I’m not confident he’ll be accepting the position as he was up front and told me that he’s expecting another offer for a full time position at another company. Assuming he doesn’t accept - we will be continuing interviews with the hope of finding someone who’s a good fit at both a skill level and team fit.

## **Upcoming Vacations**

### [Case Study: How Headspace Designs for Mindfulness](https://raw.studio/blog/how-headspace-designs-for-mindfulness/)

When we connect the user's experience directly to high-impact business metrics, we'll be driving our organization to deliver better-designed products and services.

## Andrew's Thoughts

I wanted to take a minute to share my own thoughts about the Leadership call mentioned above. The push to focus on mental health will become a central focus for 2022 and beyond. There will be some obvious projects where continuing to focus on mental health is obvious - such as AbilitiCBT or the LifeWorks platform. Where I think there’s opportunity to really embrace this idea is in our less obvious platforms - for example if we’re looking at the Responsive Enrolment Tool - are there design patterns, philosophies, or psychological techniques that we can apply to help reduce anxiety while going through the experience?

A real world example is what has been done within the Navigate platform. This is a tool meant to allow our clients to manage their accounts with LifeWorks, see how their services are being utilized and get guidance on how best to manage their workforce. The design choices made were meant to inspire a sense of calm but the item I want to highlight is an Easter egg we’ve included. When a User runs into a connection error - rather than the standard messaging of “There’s been a problem - please try again later.” we turned it into an opportunity for deep breathing. The error page includes a simple animation that the User can trigger that guides them through 1 minute of deep breathing - turning a frustrating moment into a moment of peace for the User.

I want to encourage all of you to explore these themes, study what companies like Headspace or Calm are doing and apply it to your work. As LifeWorks looks to carve out their spot as a leading Mental Health Provider - we can do the same by becoming the experts in Mental Health and Design. 

This is an exciting direction we’re going with the opportunity to make a positive impact in the lives of people all over the world. I am excited to see what we’re able to do across all of our products.

Have a great week!

Cheers,  
Andrew
