# **Weekly Newsletter Aug 9th - Aug 13th, 2021**

Happy Wednesday Everyone!

It's nice to be back after a couple of days off. This will be a quicker newsletter as there's less updates and we're already half way through the week.

##  Benefit Renewal Must Be Done By EOD Wednesday 

If you're a contractor - feel free to skip to the next item. For anyone who is full time - this is important.

The period to renew your benefits ends today. Please make this a priority as if it's not done by the end of the day - you will not be able to go in and do your enrollment. It doesn't take long - I finished mine in under 10 minutes but can make a big difference.

You can visit Generation Flex to log in and start the process. You start by selecting the CTA in the black bar above the content. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.


## Meeting with Kaytek on Friday 

Jon Darke and I will be meeting Kaytek on Friday to chat about the roadmap for the UI/UX Domain. We will be providing updates on the maturity model, resource planning and team structure. This conversation, as per usual, will either lead to a few, notable  tidbits of news or very little in the way of updates. It really depends on where the conversation ends up going. In our last conversation - it was mostly focused around resource planning for the IHS team so there wasn't too much to report but that's not to say this upcoming meeting will be more of the same.

I'll be sure to provide an update in our newsletter for next week. 

## Shared Calendar Update

We still don't quite have the calendar up and running as expected. I'm still in the process of getting this sorted out and while we're closer - it's not quite there yet. As you've all seen - we can now receive emails sent to the LifeWorks Design Organization but the shared calendar isn't quite working as expected yet. I'm still back and forth with IT on how best to get this working as needed.

I'll provide another update next week assuming there's been movement.

## Framing Yourself on Camera

As part of the continuation of the communications workshops that occurred during the QBR - I wanted to share another lesson we've learned. This was is a simpler bit of advice but still very practical - especially during these work from home times we live in right now. It's encouraged to keep your camera's on during conversations because it helps offset the feelings of loneliness and isolation a lot of us have felt during the pandemic. When you're able to see the person you're talking to - you can read their faces, gauge their reactions and feel more connected to the conversation. It's something I'm a big fan of and is why, since the internet has improved where I live, I have been joining most calls with the webcam on.

With that said - this can actually be tricky to achieve. If the camera isn't framed properly, instead of a sense of connection, it can quickly become a distraction. Instead of listening to what's being said - all you can focus on is how far up their nose you can see or you can't get past the floating forehead that appears to be talking. So here's a few simple steps you can do to make sure you're framed properly.

1. You should be in the centre of the webcam. The space should be close to equal on either side of you.
2. To get the perfect distance - pretend you have a button up shirt on. There should be about 15-30cm of space from the top of your head the the top of the screen and your top 3 buttons should fit onto the screen. If you're only showing 1 button and no space on top - you're too close but if you're showing you're whole upper torso - you're likely too far way.
3. The camera should be at a height where's it pointing directly at you. When the camera is angled too far up or down - despite how you're framed - it'll feel unnatural and there's where the "up the nose" angles often come from.

Simple advice but often things we don't think to review before jumping on a call. Hopefully this will give you some thought for the next time you jump on camera.

## **Featured Project - Unified Scheduler Post-Project Review**
![](/assets/images/unifed-scheduler-preview.jpg)

With the start of the pandemic more employees at our client companies turned to counselling for help. This meant two things—a huge increase in demand for our counsellors and therapists and an increased number of calls to our call center booking appointments. To alleviate the burden on our call center agents, we needed to decrease the number of incoming calls. That’s when the Unified Appointments (UA) project was set in motion.

This project would also be part of a company-wide effort to unify the experience for employees at our client companies. Employees would be able to schedule appointments within our large network of service providers—financial and benefit advisors, physical trainers, and wellness coaches, among others. They would be able to book appointments from any one of our apps, portals, and sites.

Regina and I were tasked to build an app called the Unified Scheduler to allow Employee to book appointments online. Not only that, but the app would also allow users to reschedule, cancel, and look up past appointments.

For the MVP, our users would be able to book a telephonic (phone call) counselling session in the LifeWorks app. They would choose a preferred appointment time, then be given a list of available counsellors. Counsellors display a short bio, years of experience, education, and credentials—all to help the user feel comfortable with the person they choose.

One important thing I learned while on this project is to make my designs airtight. I can’t begin to tell you the number of times I shared my designs with someone from the project team, only to have them point out a flaw in the logic or a piece missing from the puzzle. The reasons for that were many, not least of which is the fast pace of the project and the large scope of work, leading me to develop tunnel vision.

To counteract this, I learned to make time to review the designs regularly. I would comb through them from start to finish, backwards and sideways—until logical loopholes closed, and everything flowed smoothly.

Thank you to everyone who helped shape this app in our design review sessions! A special thank you to Tiphaine for helping us work through countless design problems, and to Regina for being an amazing mentor and collaborator.

### [The Bézier Game](https://bezier.method.ac)

I came across this on twitter after Mark Bolton shared it. I took a look and it's a fun little game that will help you improve as a designer. What is it? It's a game to help you master the pen tool.

## Andrew's Thoughts

After taking a couple of days off and remember what life was like before my Wife and I had kids(they're at camp this week) - it's reminded me just how important it is to take time away from the computer, unplug and rest. I got to enjoy flowing down a river, in a tube on Monday totally disconnected from the world was I had no phone, watch or anything else. It was a great experience which allowed me to just relax for a bit.

As the summer wraps up - I want to encourage each of you to try and find even a day or two to take for yourselves. You've all worked very hard over the last few months and deserve the opportunity to unplug and relax.

I hope you all have a great week and can't wait to catch up with all of you on what you've been up to.

Cheers,  
Andrew
