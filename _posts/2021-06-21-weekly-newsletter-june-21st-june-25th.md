##  Design Reviews and Design Feedback 

I wanted to kick things off by expanding on some comments I posted in Teams last week regarding design reviews and the need for feedback.

I've noticed lately that the weekly design reviews have getting cancelled and we're all presenting more work to business units without going through any formal review process. I'm also not the only one who's noticed - as I've had a few calls with different business groups over the last few weeks where concerns of quality, adherance to our design systems have been questioned and general concerns over whether we're capable of generating consistent designs across products. For obvious reasons - I'm sure you all can appreciate why this concerns me.

We've done so much great work getting us to this point and we've done a fantastic job of changing to expectations from "good enough for now" to "This group creates high quality solutions". This has come as a result of all of your tireless work, elevating expectations and showing everyone what we're capable of. We're now entering a new stage of our design organization's growth. We now need to ask ourselves - how to do we continue to meet and rise above the expectations folks have set for us.

I know that we are all dedicated to trying to make the best products possible and we all see design as a key element to creating a great product. This is why the design reviews and feedback from each other is so important. In the past - we knew that what we present to business, assumiung it hits on what they need, will get approved without much attention to the smaller details. Now that expectations are changing for us - this is means business groups are starting to pay more attention. I've been asked why we have design systems if we don't keep adhere to it and if anyone reviews work before it goes out. 

When I mentioned the review sessions - the response was surprise. In this particular conversation - I was then shown a few examples which seemed to indicate that no formal review had occured prior to the product owner for sign off. When I followed up - I learned that this was because no review process had occurred. I don't share this to shame people (that's why no names, business groups or products are mentioned) but instead to point out that the expectations for our group is changing.

That's why our weekly reviews and the feedback channel is so important as it lets us hold each other accountable, we can challenge each other to be better and it can open up paths to new ideas and concepts we wouldn't have thought of. I know it can hard to share work, sometimes the work isn't done yet and so it may feel like it's too early for feedback or sometimes the work is done already and we don't have the time/energy to go back and make more revisions. 

I also know it can be hard to share because it's difficult to get feedback - we all work so hard on our designs that sometimes getting feedback can feel like someone is gutting you to the core. With that said - we all (and I include myself in this) need to find ways to move past those feelings because we're missing opportunities to grow and be creative. While the feedback shouldn't be malicious - the most creative organizations reconginze that, despite how difficult it may be, challenging each other is how great products are created.

If we want to be considered a world-class design organization than reviewing each others work, providing feedback and being open to change is crucial. Reviews are here to help everyone improve as designers, to focus on the details and make better products. When one of us produces high quality products that exceeds expectations - it elevates all of us. It opens the door to new opportunities we may not have thought of before.

This is why we call our both our weekly design reviews and the feedback channel in our Design Debt Strategy. These reviews not only make us better but also gives the various business groups confidence that our solutions are accessible, follows our design systems and solves the problems that need to be solved. We should want to be held accountable by each other so that business doesn't need to.

I believe that we have the potential to be the next great design organization in Canada, similar to Shopify or Teehan+Lax, where we push progress forward and inspire other designers and organizations to be better. You all are the foundation for this and I think it's damn strong but if we want to reach this goal - we need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable and that starts with being willing to take critisim and suggestions for our work.

You can find out design debt strategy on Figma if you want to dive into the details of what has been outlined and presented to our business groups.

## Featured Work 

A new feature will be added to the newsletter moving forward - Featured Work. Each week I'll be asking someone to provide a write up on a project they've either recently finished or are presently working on. The goal of this is two fold:

1. This gives visibility to the design organization on various projects and work that we have going on.
2. It's an opportunity to learn and grow. These features will be more than just a high level synoposis like "This project is used to help people with their mental health". Instead, it'll be more detailed with a focus on what processes were followed, what challenges were encountered and what solutions were used to resolve these challenges.

The hope is that the featured work will shed some light on what we're all up to, inspire us to try new approaches and give visibility to different patterns and workflows so that the next time a similar flow needs to be created - we don't need to start the beginning.

I'd like to say Thank You to Nick Burd who provided this weeks featured work item.

## New Team Member  

I am happy to annouce that on July 5th, we'll have a new member of the team joining us. Satya Daneau will be joining the EAS team in a similar role as what Élise was doing previously. Satya will not be formally on the Enterprise team however, much like Élise and Josée, the expectation is that Satya will be apart of our group and will be available to assist us in whatever capacity we may need her in.

Satya will be starting with the EAS Admin Panel and NORI when she joins.

## Training and Professional Development Update 

In another maturity model update - we've started working with the HR department as they continue to reach level 2 maturity themselves. A key element for them is a training and development program that works for each team. I spent a decent amount of time last week, looking over what that might mean for them. Although we're still working through the details and there's no formal annoucement yet - here's an example of some of the things we're currently looking at.

We've identified the six roles that exist within the team:
1. UX Designer
2. UX Researcher
3. UI Designer
4. UI Developer
5. UX Copywriter
6. Design Manager

We've identified key hard and soft skills that are unique to each role which allowed us to focus on what type of training might be valuable. We've found courses, certifications and other resources which may be useful and are having conversations over how best to support these paths financially. 

There's still a lot of work to be done and so there may not be another update for a few weeks but I thought it was important to let folks know what the latest focus has been. The hope is that by the time we're done, there will be clear paths for professional development available to each of you with the ability to cross streams and titles if that is a direction you want to go in. (For example, if you're a UX Designer but want to do more with UX Copywriting - you'll now have some level of access of the resources and courses associated with UX Copywriting)

If you have any questions or recommended courses/certifications that you think could be valuable - please don't hestitate to send them my way.

## **Featured Project - MPC**
![](/assets/images/featured-work-mpc.jpg)
In the past year and a half I've had the pleasure of working on the reskin project - Large Market MPC application and learning a lot about the design system and implementation as I go. 

MPC (My Plans Connect Large Market) is an open enrolment benefits and retirement platform which we acquired from Mercer. With this merger I've had the opportunity to work with and learn from some great people that transitioned over from the project. This project has had it's fair share of misorganization, strong personalities that didn't always see eye to eye and issues with development. This often meant needing to spend extra time with key stakeholders to work around the noise and identify what needed to be delivered.

One of the challenges I encountered was that it became in some cases difficult to align to the design system as we were told this was a reskin only situation. Also the possibility for UX research was pretty restricted as well since the budget wasn't allowing for much time toward research. All things considered I believe the project went well, and gave us a great opportunity to start working on incorporating the design system into platforms in Morneau Shepell (LifeWorks).

I have great hopes for the future of that platform and I'm looking forward to bringing some synergy into other platforms such as the myLife portal this year.

[Up to date with the latest trends? Let’s remind ourselves of the fundamentals of visual design principles first!](https://drawer.design/blog/visual-design-principles-in-ux/})

## Andrew's Thoughts

I just finished reading a book called Originals by Adam Grant and it got me thinking about out group and our vision. As I touched on above - I really believe we have the potential to be one of the great design groups in Canada. I know a lot of us have been frustrated lately regarding last minute changes, internal politics we want nothing to do with and projects feeling unorganized. Last week was a particularly difficult week for me as I spoke with many of you in private conversations about these frustrations and more.

That's when I remember something from the book about the path trailblazers sometimes need to make. When you have ideas and concepts that are different to everyone around you - it can be hard. You're expected to fit in, follow the crowd and not question the decisions being made aruound you. When you do speak out against the crowd - folks will think you're crazy and will go out of their way to make life harder for you. Change is hard and comes with a lot of risk. When you combine the fact that most people are risk-adverse and comfortable with the status-quo, it can feel like you're trying to roll a boulder up a hill.

Now it  may not always feel like it - but we are all trailblazing and trying to make those new paths. If your last week was anything like mine - it might not always feel this way. It may feel like you've hit a wall and no matter what you try and do - no one is willing to listen. You may feel discouraged, frustrated or on the verge of apathy - the worst of all the emotions.

However, if you do feel that way, I want you to stop and think about how much we've done so far and then remember that Rome wasn't built in a day. I mentioned above that you folks are the foundation for our organization - and I can't stress that enough. It's because of our vision, your hard work, dedication and willingness to keep pushing forward even when no one is wanting follow - that we've reached where we are today.

When I joined the company, it was myself and one other UI/UX Developer and the expectations that existed for us was to be Angular Developers who could manipulate the CSS enough to make the products look good. The idea of wireframes, research, prototypes, demos, workshops, mock ups and more were foreign to everyone I worked with. If I didn't do the HTML and CSS myself - the end result would be messy and disapointing. No one cared about ensuring a consistent experience across our platforms - they only cared about closing the ticket and moving on to the next job. It didn't matter if the visual design of a product looked careless and sloppy so long as it was done. 

Which is why it's so amazing that we are were we are today and that when we look at the bigger picture - what you all have managed to do in the last 3 years is nothing short of amazing. It's because of you we now have an Enterprise Design Organization, our business groups are pushing us to be even better and we now work with stakeholders and product owners to develop ideas and concepts before the rest of IT is brought in.

When you think about where we started and we're are today - it gives me so much hope and excitment for the future because as this team grows, is pushed to be better and continues to blaze trails - the sky is the limit for us. I truly believe that this group is something special so after a week like last - I felt it was important to point out how much progress we've made and that frustrations will always exist but each of you is making a difference and I know this team will take us to new highs over the coming months and years.

Cheers,  
Andrew
