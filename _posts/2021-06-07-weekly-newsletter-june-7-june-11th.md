# **Weekly Newsletter June 7 - June 11, 2021**

Happy Monday Everyone! I hope you all enjoyed the beautiful, warm weekend. I know my family I certainly did. We spent the majority of time outside and even got into the water yesterday. I was surprised at how warm the water already was - it's a good sign as it means it should be a fun summer.

##  Updates from monthly tech leadership call 

The focus from the latest month leadership call revolved around how the IT group is performing overall as well as some further updates from HR on plans to improve professional development and training.

Overall LifeWorks is doing well as a business and as a company we are performing well. However there's some concern around our EBITDA (revenue after expenses) as it's down across all lines of business except IHS. It also appears that Admin Solutions isn't seeing as much as growth as hoped. 

Some of the concern and impacts to the EBITDA are linked to IT and that we're approx. 1 million over budget for the year. The good news is our UX groups is performing well and isn't contributing to the overages. The reason for these overages are mostly tied to costs from 2020 getting carried over. These appear to be under control now and the focus moving forward will be trying to lower that 1 million deficet. I would expect to see adjustments made to some of our projects to lower scope in order to move some of the costs to fixing some of the team budgets.

There's nothing to worry about but I did think it was important for folks to know what was occuring at LifeWorks. 

As for the HR updates, Andrea Bates is currently working with her team to help build a program that will help track professional development, identify skills and weaknesses and provide support for those wanting to improve. She is still early on in this process but folks can expect to hear more about this as new details become available.


## Update on the EAS Role 

I got a chance to interview the leading candidate for the open EAS position in Montreal. The interview went well and I believe this person could be a good fit for the team. They've got an extensive background in the digital world and has experience working with business groups closely. This could make her a strong fit for the EAS team as she's a talented designer and also know's how to work with various personalities while taking on large amounts of responsibility.

I'll share additional details once we've learned what the next steps are.

## Total Health Index Reminder  

Emails would have gone out last week about finishing the Total Health Index (TWI) on the LifeWorks platform before Wednesday EOD. There wasn't a very strong turnout as they've extended it again for a few days. If you're full time at LifeWorks - I encourage you to take it. By completing it (it takes no more than 5-10 mins) - you'll get $100.00 to put towards your benefits for the year. That's a great return on investment for your time.

## Design Debt Update 

I have recently been meeting with various folks from the Admin Solutions group to discuss next steps for design debt. So far they're pleased with the governance plans we have put in place but the conversation is on going. The biggest concerns revolve around what we're doing to identify when things change and what the impact will be.

We'll be providing some documentation shortly to the business around what platforms are using CDS and ADS - as well as what platforms are currently marked as being without any level of intergration. I would ask folks just add their products to the excel sheets listed under the Design Systems channel on Teams - this way the list is as up to date as possible.

I still expect there to be some additional news to come from the upcoming meetings but not sure yet with regards to what we should expect.

## Return of the design contest

Last year over the summer we did some design contests as a fun way to challenge our skills and grow as designers. Ultimately it only lasted a couple weeks with time, skillsets and expectations being raised as concerns. We will be bringing it back for another year with plans to address these concerns and some clarity around the the rules to help solve the concerns from last year.

Stay tuned for more details as they become available.

## Andrew's Thoughts

I wanted to take a few minutes to encourage folks to review their ultimate mission and their objectives for 2021. It's been a pretty hectic year so far and these are the first things to slip as we double down on the work we need to do to meet deadlines.

As we go into the summer and things slow down - this is the ideal time to review and figure out what you can do to get closer to the objectives we've defined together. Over the next month or two - this will become a focus for our conversations.

I've already started to review with some folks and the conversation becomes a lot easier when we don't need to stop and take a couple minutes to get up to speed over what your objectives are for the year. I absolutely love these conversations as I think it gives me a chance to get to know each of you better and help you with whatever goals you may have.

You all have such incredible missions and objectives for 2021 and I can't wait to help you get a little closer to where you want to go in your career.

Cheers,  
Andrew
