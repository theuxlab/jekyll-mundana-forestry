# **Weekly Newsletter Aug 3rd - Aug 6th, 2021**

Happy Tuesday All!

I hope you had a great long weekend and you're all feeling refreshed after a busy stretch. The newsletters are back after a little delay and I'll expand upon this below.

##  Welcome Satya 

I know I am super late on this but I wanted to make sure I called out Satya joining the team through the newsletter. It's great to have you on the team and I look forward to seeing the great work that will be produced now that Satya has joined the team.

She'll be filling the void left by Niem and Élise but with an exciting twist. If Satya has downtime or we need support and it doesn't impact any EAS iniaitives - Satya will be able to provide the help. This was something weren't able to do with Élise and I know there were times where Élise was frustrated by non-stop QA despite the fact she knew we needed help.

Please continue to make Satya feel welcomed as continue to work together.

## Branching in Figma 

Figma announced a new feature on Friday that will make branching far more impactful. Tiphaine and I will be reviewing this over the next week or two to determine whether or not it could be a suitable option for reviews and sign off. 

We will provide an update in the newsletter as soon as there's more information available to share.

## Jon Darke's Offer for Feedback  

Jon and I were talking last week about the Navigate and Nurture projects. While showing him a couple things - I used that time as an opportunity to do some A/B testing on a couple concepts we were mulling over. This turned into a great conversation where Jon shared some interesting insights and a few potential solutions that hadn't been looked at yet.

At the end of the conversation Jon offered to provide feedback to anyone who's interested. You may see him reply to some of the posts in the feedback channel, join the weekly feedback sessions when time permits and is willing to connect with folks 1 on 1 depending on availability. I encourage folks to share and take this opportunity as a chance to grow as a designer.

## Shared Calendar Update

There's been some challenges getting the shared calendar working properly. You can add it by searching for LifeWorks Design Org in Outlook but there's been difficulities posting to it. I am hoping to get the permission issues resolved this week and will share an update when fixed and working as expected.

## The Answer Pyramid

As mentioned last week - as part of the QBR's this time around - we've been doing communication coaching. I wanted to take a moment and highlight something that I learned that was valuable advice. I will likely share more of this tops if folks are interested.

The first thing I wanted to chat about was the Answer Pyramid. In North America we tend to explain our answers in detail right away - often burying the answer in a mountain of explanation. The coach calls this common approach "The Funnel" because we start with a detailed explanation only to eventually reach the answer near the end.

Instead - he recommends using the Answer Pyramid to answer questions. You would start by providing the answer in 1-2 sentences but the less words required the better. For example if someone asked "How was your weekend?" - instead of going into detail over everything you did, you'd reply with "It was great."

Once you've provided the answer - you've now got a choice. You can either pause and wait to see if folks want/need more detail or you can bridge to an answer.

The bridge can be anything from a simple pause to judge whether folks want to move on or it can be a word like "because". Using the example above - you could answer the question about your weekend, in more detail, by saying something like "It was great because...".

At that point now you can provide the additional details and explanations that provide context to your answer. This approach to answering questions allows you to streamline conversations and get answers quicker without all the added context - until it's required.

Full disclosure - I am awful at the Answer Pyramid but I am committed to getting better because I know I tend to dive into stories or long answers when a simple "Yes" or "No" would suffice. I recommend folks try it out too - it's a good approach to get used to.


## **Featured Project - MySSP**
![](/assets/images/myssp-preview.jpg)

My Student Support Program (My SSP) is a desktop and mobile platform where university students can access professional counseling as well as an extensive library of digital emotional health and wellbeing content. Since joining LifeWorks in November of last year, I’ve worked to continuously introduce new features and improve its existing UX/UI. 

When I took on this project, My SSP existed outside of a design system, making it feel disconnected from the LifeWorks brand. Thus, one of the challenges I faced was bringing the old SSP design to be more aligned with the Consistency Design System. With a small team and a priority to introduce new features, we couldn’t instantaneously overhaul SSP’s design and code. The solution was to gradually introduce elements from the design system into new designs, and have the developers work on them incrementally. I’m very grateful to the My SSP team for being receptive to these design changes throughout the process.

I’m eager to see My SSP evolve as we continue to make strides towards a more streamlined platform - both visually and from a coding perspective. I am confident in My SSP’s ability to make a meaningful impact on students’ lives, and am glad to be working on it with an awesome team.

As a designer, our focus is on users’ needs and their interactions with our products/services. Our aim is to design the functionality that helps them to achieve their goals as efficiently and effectively as possible. But we also have to focus on their responses, which are naturally emotional.

Emotions are very important part of humans as they have power to influence our behaviours such as the way we make decisions, evaluate risks and solve problems. To design accurately for humans and their needs, we should look through the behaviour science-lens.

Here’s some interesting articles to help us to learn more about human behaviours before we start nudging them.

## Andrew's Thoughts

I wanted to end this by apologizing to all of you for not sending out the newsletter over the course of July. While I didn't intend to wait this long in between newsletter - I did have a realization that there will be periods where things are busy at the start of the week and the newsletter doesn't get the attention it needs. 

I want to thank Goli and Lynn for providing their content and being patient with me while I continually held off sending the newsletter off. The contributions from each of you make preparing the newsletter easier to do.

I plan on doing my best to maintain weekly newsletters as I think it's a great way to keep everyone up to date but I also promise not to let a month lapse between newsletters.

Otherwise - I hope you all have a great week and can't wait to see what awesome stuff you come up with next.

Cheers,  
Andrew
