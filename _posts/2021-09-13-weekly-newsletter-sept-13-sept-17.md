# **Weekly Newsletter Aug 23rd - Aug 27th, 2021**

Happy Wednesday all! Sorry for the delayed reply - I wrote this Monday but didn't get a chance to publish until Wednesday so there may be a few references to Monday as Today. I hope you had a great weekend and wanted to take a moment to welcome Nick back after the birth of Hannah. I just hope Nick‚Äôs drinking enough coffee to stay awake while at work. üòÅ

##  Timesheets are due this week 

I wanted to remind everyone to find time this week to either submit your time via 1MSI or to Mel this week. It‚Äôs important we get our time in before the end of the month as it can end up messing up the monthly reports. This can ultimately impact what we‚Äôre able to do with the team as anytime that is not recorded comes out of our budget.

I don‚Äôt normally make this a big priority as you folks generally do a good job but we didn‚Äôt do a great job (and I include myself in that) at making sure our hours were submitted on time. I ended up needing to reach out to a few of you after getting an email from finance flagging everyone who‚Äôs hours were missing.

This will likely become more of a priority over the coming months and I encourage you all to capitalize your time as much as possible. This is because‚Ä¶


## Budgets, Hours and Projects will be under more scrutiny 

We had our latest Senior Leadership Call this morning and there was a clear theme that emerged which I would say you should all come to expect over the coming months. Although LifeWorks is doing a great job at generating revenue - we‚Äôre not doing such a great job on EBITDA. For those who aren‚Äôt sure what I am talking about:

Revenue - How much money the company makes before operating expenses such as employee salaries, software, hardware and other factors.

EBITDA - How much money the company makes once you factor in all of the operating expenses.

There are two areas that we are affected by via EBITDA not being as strong. The first impacts the different lines of business as they need to get their numbers turned around and the other is the IT budget who also has to turn their numbers around. 

This is notable because there‚Äôs going to be a push to review projects to figure out how to keep their costs down from LOBs and Project Owners as well as more scrutiny around hirings, promotions and team budgets. 

Our group is in a good position from a budget perspective but I think it‚Äôs a good bet to expect to feel impact as the other LOBs and Departments try to break even by the end of the year.


## HR Webinars for the rest of the year

I wanted to share quickly the list of webinars scheduled from the remainder of 2021. There‚Äôs some good topics that will be focused on over the coming months and I know HR spends a lot of time and effort getting guests and putting these sessions together.

If you see something that catches your eye - I recommend attending as I have no doubts you‚Äôll appreciate the outcome.

## Starting the search for new contractors

We will be looking to bring on a couple of contractors to support us over the next couple of months. We are needing to add another UI Developer to support Ron in HPS as they look to implement the new rebrand. This will likely be a temporary position as we continue to evaluate the need for multiple UI Developers with our current project load and dynamic with the engineering department.

The second role will be a copywriter for Navigate and the Unified Login tool. As it stands this role will be brought on as a temporary position but the hope will be that we can generate enough momentum until the end of the year so that we can look to add that skill set permanently to our team.

If you know anyone for either position that you think could be a good fit - feel free to share their resume or portfolio for us to take a look at.


## Design Contest Update

Earlier I mentioned that we wanted to run another design contest. This is still the plan and more details will be announced later this week.

## Andrew's Thoughts

There‚Äôs a lot going on these days from an IT business perspective that could impact how we work until the end of the year and into 2022. I know that I mentioned last week Kaytek spoke about some potential org restructuring coming to IT and above I mentioned that the budgets and costs will be under closer review until the end of the year.

I wanted to end by stressing that none of this is anything we need to be worried about. Our group is in a great position from a budget standpoint and IT is focused continuing to make LifeWorks a product-centric organization. This strategy means focusing on the Customer/User experience and I expect that our role and influence will continue to grow.

While I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in store until the end of 2021 - what I have heard is exciting. Executives like Kaytek, Norah and DJ recognize how a strong product experience is key to success and we‚Äôll be expected to play a key role in becoming a product-centric, user-first organization.

With that said - if any of you have any questions - please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out and we can discuss further in more detail.

Cheers,  
Andrew
