# **Weekly Newsletter Sept 13th - Sept 17th, 2021**

Happy Monday Everyone. It's hard to believe we're already in the middle of September. The year is flying by and summer appears behind us now. I would say we should expect things to get busy over the coming weeks as we move into Q4.

##  Goodbye Josie 

Unfortunately we kick this week off with some unfortunately news - Josie will be leaving LifeWorks on after Wednesday to start an exciting next step in her career. In the last three years with us, Josie has worked on stuff for Harmony, MyLife, Benefit Enrolment, MyPlans Connect, Financial Wellbeing and Navigate. 

Josie, along with Rabeea, was one of the first designers who joined the team without the expectation of also coding. She helped paved the way for where we are now and it’s been an absolute pleasure watching her grow as both a designer and a person.

While Josie’s last day will be Wednesday - we’ll have a going away party for her on Tuesday. I’ll be sending the invite out shortly and just like with the others we’ll have some games and laughs.

Please feel free to reach out to Josie and wish her well prior to the party.

## Welcome Kevin 

Keeping on the trend of people - I do have some exciting news to share. We’ve extended a contract offer to Kevin Kelly (no relation) who’s a talented UI Developer. Kevin will be coming in to assist with the Abiliti rebrand work that’s about to start.

We will likely be leaning on Kevin for some support with Consistency as well other projects, such as the Unified Login product which is set to kick off soon.

We’re still nailing down a start date but I’ll be sure to let everyone know once it’s been finalized. It’s currently depending on when all the paperwork is finished - although I’m hopeful to have an answer before the end of the day.


## General IT Updates

There’s not too much to share with regards to the current state of the IT however I wanted to just give folks the latest updates as we progress through September.

The first draft of the the 2022 budget is due in at the end of the month. This means we’ll likely start getting some clarity over what projects we’ll be focusing on next year, if there will be any meaningful movement in the IT Org structure and more over the coming days and weeks.

As mentioned - there’s nothing to report right now but that could change as the week goes on. I’ll be sure to keep everyone up to date as details become available either via the newsletter or (depending on the news) by calling a meeting.

It appears as though there’s already 41 Capital Projects being planned for 2022 but I expect that number to either increase or for some of those projects to be broken down into smaller initiatives under a parent project.

## Tracking Performance

I have started to build out some dashboards to get a better sense of our workload, skillsets, timelines and and quality.

There will be some additional updates to come with other sources of data but to start we will be looking at 1MSI and Figma analytics to get a sense of how the team is performing.

I am hoping to eventually leverage ADO down the road as well.

The Figma Analytics are already starting to show some interesting stories in terms of when we’re busiest and when we’re slower. For the Figma data, we’re looking at using the Design Systems as a way of measuring quality.

We will be looking at CDS and Harmony Design Systems to measure component utilization, how frequent components are getting detached, how many projects are using the systems and more.

Hopefully over time - we’ll be able to prove the value we provide. I expect ADO being a big help as we can measure the impact of projects working with us vs working without us.

If you have questions, ideas, want to see what’s been or more - just let me know. I’d like to share these updates with the team moving forward either during our monthly team call or in one of the weekly newsletters.

## Andrew's Thoughts

Lately I’ve been reading a book called “How to Think More Effectively” and this weekend I came across a chapter about a certain form of thinking that really resonated with me and I want to encourage you all to do more of.

What is this form of thinking? It was called “Mad Thinking” and the premise is we chase away any thoughts or ideas that aren’t rooted in reality. We often dismiss ideas or concepts because we don’t think it can be done.

For example - you may get an interesting idea and then your next thought becomes “Oh - that would be too expensive. Business would never agree to that” and you dismiss the idea before getting a chance to dive deeper into it.

These thoughts are called “Mad Thoughts” because in their rawest form - reality wouldn’t support it. There are limitations in areas like technology, money, opportunity or general support and so we move on from the idea.

However - it’s these ideas or thoughts which serve as the bedrock of another idea or concept that’s is rooted in reality. When we give ourselves permission to unshackle ourselves from the limitations of the real world - we can find ourselves going down rabbit holes that ultimately lead to something meaningful.

An example might be thinking about how to use virtual reality to serve up a different benefit enrolment experience - something no one has seen before. In the end - the solution is impractical because not enough people have VR Headsets that they can use for this new experience and the cost to create such an experience is beyond the available budget.

However while mapping out the idea of how you might do VR for Benefit Enrolment, your revised flow and how you grouped available options is feasible and a far better experience than anything we had before.

The only reason you had revised the flow and the different groupings was to support the VR experience - but in the end the solution made the product better today. This is the beauty of “Mad Thinking” by giving yourself permission to follow these crazy ideas - you can stumble onto something great that works right now.

So I encourage all of you to take time and allow yourself to think about what the possibilities when you take the time to think differently.
Cheers,  
Andrew
