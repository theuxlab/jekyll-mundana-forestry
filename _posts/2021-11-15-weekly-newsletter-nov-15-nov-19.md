# **Weekly Newsletter Nov 15th - Nov 19th, 2021**

Happy Monday Everyone! I hope you all had a great week. It’s hard to believe it’s already mid-November and the end of the year is upon us. I apologize for not getting a newsletter out sooner due to some demo and meeting conflicts - it made it difficult to get something together in a timely fashion. As a result this will be a slightly longer newsletter than usual.

##  Glint Survey Results are In 

We’ll start with some good news and that is that our Glint Survey results have come in for the end of the year and are Engagement Score stayed at 85/100. This was great to see as the majority of the company noticed a slight downturn in terms of scores. The benchmark we’re expected to meet is 75/100 and for a couple of comparisons - LifeWork’s overall score was 71/100 and IT’s overall score was 72/100.

Over the course of the next few months - there were three areas called out for our group as opportunities to improve. Those three sections are Collaboration within LifeWorks, Belonging with LifeWorks and feeling empowered in making decisions about the work we do. I understand that some of the concern here isn’t within out group but how we work with other groups and part of the plan will be to try and figure out how to make things better.

Given that belonging is listed here - that’s the perfect segue to…

## Holiday Party Update 

While we are still looking at the details - given the where we’re at with the office reopening and COVID policies now being implemented - we are currently looking at doing an holiday party as a group. While we’re still looking to finalize some of the details and figure out what the rules will be for group sizes - I wanted to let folks know that we may finally get a chance to meet each other for the first time in almost 2 years (or in the case of some - first time ever).

There will still be some details we need to iron out and I’ll be connecting with everyone individually to make sure their comfortable with this but I know many of you have expressed an willingness to gather as a group and we may finally have the green light to do just that.

## Feature Teams for 2022

As Jon and I mentioned as new details come to light for what a potential merger could look like - the latest news comes in the form of feature teams. It looks like LifeWorks will be moving away from our traditional setup of LOBs and set number of projects per LOB and towards a Feature Team like model that would see teams responsible for a variety of projects and initiatives over the course of the year. We’ve already seen this start to happen as we’ve been working with teams like HPS’s Feature Team 3 through 5. This trend is expected to continue through more of the IT Department but with one big difference - teams will now get a minimum of 1 designer on any project that might require UI work.

This means we can spend less time focused on what’s capital and what’s not capital and more time focused on improving whatever products our feature teams are set to support. While some folks may find that they’re being asked to balance their time between multiple teams - the goal is to limit folks to supporting only one or two feature teams. This new strategy will likely take some getting used to but ultimately this puts us in a position where we can support products beyond it’s initial lifecycle and be able to deal with concerns like design debt or product refinements without wondering how we’ll get a group to pay for it.

There will be more updates coming about this as we try and figure out how this new approach will affect the design team org structure and who ultimately supports what - but early on this looks to be a very exciting adjustment which should lead to us improving the quality of our work and products because we’ll have the time needed to research, review and refine our solutions.

## WorkDay has Launched

As most of you know - Workday was opened up to the organization last week. I want to encourage you all to go in and take a look. It’s a good idea to verify the information listed is correct and that there’s no notable discrepancies listed. If you do notice anything - you can open an HR ticket and they’ll address it. We’ve already noticed that Tiphaine and Kevin are listed out of the wrong office but otherwise it does sound like things are been fairly straightforward… with one exception…

Vacation Time is confusing as hell. Instead of showing time off using days - Workday instead shows time off through hours. This is due to the fact we’re a global company where every country, province and state all have different rules about what is considered time off, how to record time off and how to show time off. It comes from the fact that not everyone at LifeWorks are 9-5 employees and we have folks who are shift workers or part time and so the easiest (and in some places legal) way to present time off is through hours and not days.

What folks need to know is that the formula to convert hours to days is fairly straight forward. There’s two formula’s you really need to know about:

The first is to calculate how much time off you have for the year:
**(Accrued Year To Date + (9.375 * Months Remaining)) / 7.5**

So what the above Formula is telling you to do is look at how many hours you’ve earned over the course of the year (Accrued Year to Date) and then add the number of hours yet to be accrued over the remainder of the year. Each month you would earn 9.375 hours in vacation time which is why we use that number and times it by the months remaining. This would give you the total number of hours you get for the year - and then you divide it by 7.5 to convert the hours to days as WorkDay represents a day as 7.5 hours.

To figure out how many days you have left you can then use this formula:
**Beginning Period Balance / 7.5**

This looks at how many hours you have remaining at the start of a month and then we divide it by 7.5 to convert the hours to days. One thing worth noting is if you need to take time off before you’ve accrued the hours - you can but think of it like a credit card. Instead of earning additional hours - you switch over to paying the hours back. If you were to leave the company before you’ve paid those hours back - depending on what’s remaining there may be an expectation to pay back those hours.

Finally for things like Wellbeing Days or other time off options - these are less clear as to what to expect. I believe Wellbeing Days are likely to stay fixed as we’ve always been flexible with those hours but I don’t know what the WorkDay expectations will be moving forward. This may be something we need to return to depending on how it’s expected to work moving forward.

## Challenges with Abstract

I’m pleased to see us moving forward with Abstract and as of using it for 2 weeks as a full design organization we are now up to 37 active Notebooks running. This is great to see and thus far the general feedback I’ve heard has been mostly positive but with that said - we have noticed a few bugs or challenges as we’ve been working with it. As a result - there’s been a notebook setup under “Documentation” that allows folks to track any issues or concerns with Abstract.

If you’ve encountered a challenge yourself - please don’t hesitate to add. We’ll be sharing these notes with Abstract to let them know where we’ve run into concerns or challenges in the hopes of getting those issues addressed.

If you don't see your name listed - please be sure to add the time to WorkDay as I'll be pulling this time off from there moving forward.

### [Measuring Design Podcast](https://podcast.clearleft.com/season03/episode05/)

A great podcast from the folks at Clearleft which dives into the difference ways to measure whether or not a design solution works for your Users.

## Andrew's Thoughts

As we get closer to Christmas and things slow down - we’ll start seeing more and more folks start taking time off. I’ll be taking some time off during the end of the year and I know others have similar plans. Please try to add your time to WorkDay so that we can plan accordingly. I mention this though because I don’t expect things to get too much busier for our group over the next few weeks - in fact I anticipate we will have a chance to breathe.

As things slow down a bit - we’ll turn our attention to some internal house keeping items that we’ve been talking about over the last few months. I’m hoping we’ll launch our public persona but rolling out a presence on social media, re-launching our blog and finally launching a podcast. These have been items that have been on the back burner through most of the year but given the fact we are closing into the end of the year and things should be slowing down - now is the perfect time to try and get some of these initiatives off the ground.

If you have an idea for a blog or if there’s a topic you’d like to chat about via the podcast format - please let me know. I’ll be reviewing our 1 on 1’s schedules this week and the we will likely use some of that time to discuss these things. I’d just like to encourage folks to start thinking about what they’d either like to talk about to hear us talk about.

We will also be looking to launch our presence on places like Behance and Dribbble so don’t be surprised if someone reaches out to see if you’d be willing to share something you’re working on. This is an exciting time for our group because it gives us the chance to elevate you all and showcase the great work that’s being done beyond just LifeWorks and instead to the greater design community.

As always if you have any questions or concerns - please don’t hesitate to reach out so we can discuss further.

Have a great week everyone.

Cheers,  
Andrew
