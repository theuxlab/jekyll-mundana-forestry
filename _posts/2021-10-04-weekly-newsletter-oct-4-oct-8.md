# **Weekly Newsletter Oct 4th - Oct 8th, 2021**

Happy Monday Everyone! Hard to believe it's already October. I don't know about the rest of you but I feel like the summer went by in a blink of the eye. I'm not sure I'm quite ready for the cooler weather yet! Hopefully it's milder fall and winter takes it's sweet time to arrive.

##  Congratulations to Ron 

I want to encourage everyone to take a few minutes out of their busy week to reach out to Ron and offer him up congratulations or words of wisdom as heâ€™s set to get married this coming weekend. Lindsay is a lucky woman! (Or should I say Ron is a lucky man?!?!)

## WorkDay is Coming 

As I am sure many of you noticed this morning - there were a handful of invites waiting in your inbox to start onboarding you to WorkDay. This is something we havenâ€™t spent much time talking about yet but was on my list of things to bring up as we kick off October - the invites just served as the perfect reminder.

WorkDay is a new product that we will be rolling out throughout the company for an improved HR experience. As many of you have experienced first hand - 1MSI can be difficult to navigate and use. Itâ€™s a pain to record time, find the right codes and pull reports. The most exciting news about WorkDay (or at least one of the most exciting things) is that itâ€™ll be replacing 1MSI as a way of recording time. WorkDay works with Macs and is a far superior experience for recording time. Iâ€™ve had a chance to see a few workshops already and Iâ€™ve been pleased thus far.

WorkDay will also make it easier to tracking time off, performance reviews, yearly goals and a lot more. I suggest making it a priority this month to attend one of the onboarding sessions as this will become a key tool for our organization moving forward. This has been something thatâ€™s nearly 2 years in the making so expect to see a big push coming from a variety of people over the important and value of what it brings to the company.

## 2022 Projects are taking shape

It is looking like 2022 will be a very busy year for our organization with opportunities to grow the team. Thereâ€™s currently 45 projects marked for capital support next year and having gone through an early list it looks as if 34 of those initiatives will require our involvement with many of them being year old projects requiring multiple people.

Iâ€™m still working to firm up what projects weâ€™ll be involved in and which groups will be getting the work but it certainly looks like thereâ€™s a lot of working come in thatâ€™ll be fun. One project that has peaked my interest is that we may finally get a chance to make a dent in the IHS Call Centre software. It was initially created back in 2008 and weâ€™ve had little input in the product over its lifecycle. This will be a massive effort but one that can ultimately help a lot of people both within the organization and for all our clients.

None of the projects or their budgets have been finalized for 2022 so I expect that the numbers of projects will change as business cases are either approved or denied but I can say that Iâ€™m excited for whatâ€™s incoming for next year.

## QBRâ€™s start this week

So itâ€™s once again QBR season kicking up as we start looking back at the work weâ€™ve done over the last quarter and look ahead to whatâ€™s remaining for the end of the year. The format is changing slightly this month as we will be looking at a few things from a 2022 budget perspective but I still anticipate there being opportunities to showcase some of the great stuff you folks have been up to the last few months.

As we get closer to our presentation, which will be closer to the end of the month, I will likely need to reach out to certain individuals to review what weâ€™ve put together or get some additional information as we look to highlight projects or accomplishments.

I will be sure to keep everyone in the loop via the newsletters with any news or interesting insights that might be shared over the next few weeks.

## Thanksgiving Weekend

As mentioned above - this upcoming weekend will be the Thanksgiving Long Weekend. I hope you all use the Monday off to enjoy time with family, friends and also to get in a little bit of rest as well. Youâ€™ve all earned it.

### [ðŸŽ‰ Modules @ your fingertips!](https://twitter.com/SalesforceUX/status/1445109000446545925)

An interesting tweet I saved from Salesforce Design that speaks to Values Based Design, Accountability in Design and Design as a Social Practice. Full disclosure - I haven't had a chance to go through them in great detail yet but what I've seen so far peaked my interest enough that I wanted to share it with you folks.  


## Andrew's Thoughts

I wanted to finish off by spending a few more minutes talking about the potential projects that are coming in for 2022. While nothing is final - I think thereâ€™s a few things worth taking into consideration still for what we can expect. This was the first year where the UI/UX Group contributed to building out projects - or at least provided materials to help guide the budget process.

A few months ago I shared with everyone a plan for moving forward and how we would be looking to use fit into Bronze, Silver and Gold plans. The hope was to start getting those planning the project budgets to think about what sort of UX engagement theyâ€™d need and what was available to them. While I donâ€™t know if each project ultimately decided to use our structure - thereâ€™s already been a few folks who mentioned their interest in the gold package.

I think thereâ€™s a good chance weâ€™ll be growing as a team in 2022 as teams understand that our model moving forward rarely supports a single contributor to larger projects. This was something weâ€™ve struggled with in the past and managed to show over the course of 2021 the value of having more than one designer on a project. This is why we now have multiple designers supporting initiatives like MyLife, Navigate and Financial Wellbeing. 

Weâ€™ve still got a long road ahead of us and until everything is final and confirmed - thereâ€™s no guarantees that our new structure will be embraced but the fact that weâ€™ve contributed to this point and that multiple product owners have expressed willingness to embrace research, content strategy, proper UX and more is a positive sign. While I think thereâ€™s still a long road ahead - itâ€™s exciting to see whatâ€™s in the roadmap for 2022 and knowing that weâ€™ve provided some level of guidance into what to expect or need from our group.

There will likely be opportunities for increased responsibility and chances to work on new things. Iâ€™ll admit that while the project list for next year is, at times, overwhelming to thinking about - itâ€™s because thereâ€™s an opportunity to have a positive impact on a lot of people both inside of LifeWorks and to our clients and our users.

Once the projects are confirmed - I will release the full list and give folks the opportunity to see whatâ€™s coming and once out we can start having conversations about whether thereâ€™s certain teams or projects you may be interested in supporting.

Until then - have a great week and enjoy the upcoming long week.

Cheers,  
Andrew
