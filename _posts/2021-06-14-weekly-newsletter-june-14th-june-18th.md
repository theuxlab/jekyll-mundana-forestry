# **Weekly Newsletter June 7 - June 11, 2021**

Happy Monday Everyone!

Thank you everyone for reaching out after Friday's unexpected turn of events. Ben is alright and after spending close to 6 hour at the E.R. - we got the good news that his wrist wasn't broken. It was just swollen and bruised and had you seen him on Saturday - you would have had no idea he was hurt at all.

In the end - we ended up having a nice weekend out in the sun. Hopefully you all found some time to enjoy the warm weather as well.

##  Glint Survey Reminder 

Every few months - LifeWorks sends out the Glint Survey with the hopes of everyone doing it to get a pulse of the organization in the moment. I know I appreciate seeing the survey results as I try to make the items flagged a priority for me for the coming months. While I'm not able to see your comments (we're too small of a team) - the overall scores help influence where I'm supposed to focus.

An example that was flagged in our last survey was COVID-19 support - which is why I've tried to make a point in these newsletters to let folks know of our policies, that they can take time off for vaccines, reminders of our EAP services and encouraging vacation. I'll make sure to take the items flagged in the next survey and do my best to improve them however I can.

The survey is available for all full timers but it's not always available for contractors. You should know if you're eligiable based on if you've got any emails asking you to do the Glint survey.

It closes on the 15th - so please try and make a priority for today or tomorrow.

## Update on the EAS Role 

The interview process went well and after some robust internal dialogue between the EAS group and our team - we've extended an offer to the candidate. We are now just waiting to hear whether or not she's accepted the offer.

Once I know if the offer has been accepted - I'll share details on the candidate and when they're expected to start with LifeWorks.

## HUGE is back  

We've started working with HUGE again for the Navigate project to complete a demo. They'll be following our lead for the Navigate project but I'm excited that they'll be helping us firm up the vision of Navigate - as the original plan likely would have made time management more of a balancing act for the Enabled team.

We'll be sure to share progress with folks if anything interesting or unique comes from the partnership. I'll also be sure to share any demo work with the group for those who are curious about the direction of Navigate.

## Engagement Criteria & Design Debt Strategy Update 

The Engagement Criteria is back on my radar this week after needing to pause it in order to focus on other iniaitives. As I start working to put the deck together - I may reach out to some of you for feedback or suggestions.

I'm also continuing to meet with the Admin Solutions business group to continue reviewing the Ariel Design System (ADS) Governance process this week. So far the conversations have been good and we'll likely be extending our CDS governance process to ADS with some minor tweaks likely for both systems. I'll share an update on where things stand in our next newsletter.

## Guest Speakers

Jon Darke and I meet weekly to discuss the team and one topic that came up in our last conversation was looking to bring some guest speakers in throughout the year during our monthly meeting. We've been talking about some names and dates that could work such as Andy Clarke, Paul Boag and Andy Budd but there's still a lot of work we'll need to do to get this sorted out.

We're hoping, however, to try and get a speaker within the next 2 months - assuming we can work out the logistics. Once we've got more details - I'll be sure to share an update with everyone.

## Andrew's Thoughts

Demo season is upon us once more. I know many of you, much like myself, are currently dealing with trying to balance your time between your regular deliverables and demo work. I have had numerous demo requests come in over the last few days and have started to turn folks away with last minute requests and needs.

I bring this up to let folks know that while demos are important - they shouldn't take over your schedule unless you've got an understanding with product owners regarding time and expectations. I know sometimes demo requests will come in that require 40 hours of work - but there's no willingess to pause active iniaitives... or the person requesting just doesn't care that you've got other responsibilities as well.

If you're in this situation or find yourself in this situation - please reach out to me and we can work on a plan. I know it can be difficult to say No sometimes but depending on the request - we need to for our own sanity. I had a request come in last week where they wanted us to recreate a platform, with multiple tools that were expected to work while also supporting both English and French. These requests can take several weeks and require multiple people - and with this request was a turnaround time of 4 days. This is an example of when to (politely) say No.

So the next time someone reaches out to you for a demo - just make sure the request is reasonable and you can handle the workload. If not - let me know and we'll work with business to find a solution that can work for everyone.

Cheers,  
Andrew
