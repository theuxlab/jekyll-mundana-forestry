##  CDS Update üé®

As I am sure some of you have already noticed - we have begun updating the Consistency Design System with the latest typography and colour changes to align with the new brand rollout.

Tiphaine has been working alongside Stefania to work through the details surronding the colours and filling in the gaps so we can support our needs, which includes dark mode. You can expect additional tweaks and changes over the coming days and weeks and we move to further align with the new LifeWorks brand.

I've also started to update our code repo to reflect these changes. So far we've added the fonts and colours to the code base but I expect further refinements will be required. We've also added links and grid ability to the code repo, although I still need to provide the supporting documentation.

Expect further updates when it comes to the changes that are being made for CDS.

## Summer Vacations üå¥

That time of the year is fast approaching - summertime! I want to encourage folks to take some time off this summer break and rest. With COVID-19 and the stay at home order currently in place - Burn out is a theme that's presenting across the workforce. 

A good way to help combat that is by taking some time off for yourself to recharge. Please reach out to me as you decide what time you'll be taking so we can make sure we can support your projects while you're off.

## Timesheets ‚è∞

The timesheets for May will need to be completed by the end of this week. Please make sure you schedule some time to get your hours together and either input them into 1MSI or [email Melissa Navia](mailto:melissa.navia@lifeworks.com). 

We've been doing well with out time tracking the last two months as we put the majority of our time against capital projects. As long as we continue to do this - we can put ourselves in a position to do some internal projects and actually fund them, convert contractors to full time and/or hire more help.

If you have any questions, or need a code - please don't hesitate to reach out.

## Vaccines Reminder üò∑

I wanted to keep the vaccines policy in the newsletter - just in case anyone missed it last week. You've got up to 3 hours to get the vaccine as per LifeWorks policies. That said - if you need more time or need some support covering work while getting your vaccine - please reach out. We can work together to come up with a plan to make sure you don't miss your opportunity to get vaccinated.

You can [see the full policy here](https://msoit.sharepoint.com/sites/Panorama/SitePages/Paid-time-off-for-employees-to-receive-COVID-19-vaccine.aspx?from=SendByEmail&e=QUvoN5oiT0CwlFvcFbAgYQ&at=9).

I know a lot of you felt the Leafs being in the playoffs was one of the biggest items of news from last week. üòâ  As a result, I wanted to share a quick update to ensure everyone is up to date.

After losing thier first match, in a close game (also scary as the Leafs captain suffered a frightening injury to his head) - the Leafs have come back to win the next two. They play again tonight and could finish the series as early as Thursday. I promise I'll keep everyone up to date with the latest developments. üòÅ

## Andrew's Thoughts

I wanted to take a few minutes providing an update on the budget. In March, we had a pretty good month and ended up saving $4000.00 against our monthly budget. This was a big moment because it became the first time this year that our budget for the month was a positive. In January and Feburary our numbers weren't as great, partially because of 2020 and some carryover numbers that needed to be accounted for. As a result, by the end of Feburary we were in the hole by nearly $20k. At the time, I was told it wasn't time to worry yet because it was too early in the year to see any trends.

March was so notable because it was the first time we started to see our budget balance out a bit. If the rest of the months resembed March, we'd be back in the black in a few months and would end the year in the positive. We would likely even have the opportunity to either convert some of our contractors, invest in new technology/processes/systems, invest in side projects or look at do some sort of additional education/training.

Then our April numbers came in - and they were better than expected. We ended up billing more time to our capital projects than expected and as a result ended the month by being up $30,000.00 against our monthly budget. This was a shocking thing to see as it brought us back into the black far early than expected. We now have a surplus against the year to work with and while we'll be careful about how that surplus is spent - April has opened the window for us to be able to do more than we expected for 2021.

Since we've had 4 months of numbers come in and they have been so inconsistent - I want to wait until the May numbers are in before we start making too many plans. I'll chat more about this in our team call this week but this is something we should all be very excited for. This has the opportunity to do some of the things we've been wanting to do with the design systems, the team, processes, technology and more - and that is a positive for all of us.

If you've got questions about this and want to learn more - please don't hesitate to reach out for more information. I'm happy to talk about it.

Cheers,  
Andrew
