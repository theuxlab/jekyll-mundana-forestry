# **Weekly Newsletter Aug 9th - Aug 13th, 2021**

Happy Monday Everyone!

I hope you all enjoyed another nice weekend, although I did find it a little cooler than I'd prefer but I'm also one of the crazy ones who enjoyed it while it was 40 degrees out.

##  Congratulations to Nick and Sam! 

The most exciting news is regarding Nick. He and his Wife welcomed Hannah, their fourth, into the world early Sunday Morning.

Nick will be off for the next week but that shouldn't stop you from reaching out with congratulatory messages. 


## Update on the meeting with Kaytek 

As mentioned last week, Jon Darke and I met with Kaytek on Friday to discuss the state of the design team. In the end we spoke about two core things over the course of our 30 minutes together. 

The first was to do with tracking our work and finding a system that works well with ADO without adding extra effort. We are looking at a few options already and will be meeting with Shai's team later this month to discuss how ADO could help with forecasting and planning.

The second thing we spoke about was tied to some of the organization changes, such as the Core Portal Team moving from Mike to George Morris of Admin Solutions. It sounds like there will be some additional opportunities for our team in the near future that could result in additional team members being hired and further integration of our team into product strategy.

I should have more updates on some of this over the coming weeks as this conversation was mostly hypothetical. Until the budgets are approved and further conversations have occurred to define what it means for the IT departments - I likely won't have any more updates on this subject but promise to keep folks in the loop as new information becomes available.


## Branching Update and Design Approval

So Tiphaine and I spent some time looking at the branching functionality in Figma as a way of managing both multiple versions of designs as well as going through the approval process. Unfortunately during that time frame - it became clear that branching isn't ready for our needs and that their approval process leaves a lot to be desired. The UX on getting approval feels clunky and counter-intuitive. 

We will not be moving forward with branching from a design review/approval process and while I'm OK if you want to use branching as part of your workflow - I'd just warn being careful as it has shown some unreliability in our tests.

## No Featured Project this week

There will be no featured project this week as I didn't get a chance to reach out to anyone and give them the time needed to write something. With that said - I am looking for volunteers. If you'd like to see something you've either worked on or you're currently working on - let me know and we'll be sure to include it in the newsletter moving forward.

The same goes for links - if there's a cool website, app or article you wanted to highlight - feel free to share it with me and I'll be sure to include it in the newsletter.


## Learn about the 3 C's

In another chapter of things learned from the communication workshop - today I wanted to highlight the 3 C's. The 3 C's are the core of communicating with each other and all influence how we interact with each other and how serious we take one another. It's rare to see folks hit on all 3 C's when delivering their messages but the more you factor in - the better communicator you'll become. You'll often find that folks have 1 if the C's but lack in the others. When you're able to elevate to including another C or all of them that's when you'll go from a good presentation to a great one.

### Credibility
The first C is all about how credible you or your message is. What might surprise you is that this is not the most important C as credibility can swing wildly as its dependant on a variety of factors out of your control - such as where you work. Credibility can get you in the door but after a certain point - you need to rely on other factors if you want to continue to influence people with your message. In the same vain - assuming that your message is strong enough - it can also overcome any negative factors that may influence your credibility.

A lot of folks will ride Credibility as their only C. It may be that they found success early that they continue to ride or they lean on external factors, like where they work, to give them credibility but if those dynamics shift at all than you lose all influence moving forward.

### Content
This is the most important C and can often overcome deficiencies in the other two C's. Content is all about your actual message and what you're trying to communicate. When the content is rich, engaging and meaningful it can drive successful outcomes. This often means catering the content to the appropriate audience - for example sharing detailed design decisions is great when presenting for approval or to the product owner but may fall flat to a stakeholder or during a client presentation. In the same vain, sharing high level decisions may work for a client call but would likely result in frustration for someone trying to understand all the factors that went into a decision.

Content can make or break a presentation and is often the difference between leaving a meeting with a feeling of "This was a waste of time" or "That was a great meeting".

### Connection
The last C is almost as important as Content and that's the connection you're able to establish with those you're presenting to. This is all about talking TO and WITH those in the presentation instead of AT them. Connection is a combination of our Physical Presence, Verbal Presence and the words we are actually saying. For example, making eye contact with folks during the presentation, asking them questions to keep them engaged and doing little things like using our hands to communicate the right messages.

When you're able to make meaningful connections your content is easier heard and your credibility improves. For example - Who would you rather hear from?

**Mary**
Mary gets excited about what she's talking about, making eye contact with you and physically expressing herself through her hands to to show how sales will increase with her idea.

**Mike**
Mike is nervous and keeps looking down at his cue cards. He rarely looks up and when he does it's only to point to a slide in his deck. Mike is stiff as he presents and his voice stays level and monotone.

Who would you rather listen to? Mary, who tried to bring you with her on presentation or Mike, who just spoke at you. I think we've all been in enough meetings to know, whether the ideas are good or not, Mary is far more likely to hold the room's attention.

A neat tool I stumbled onto from Twitter. You just need to upload an SVG and you can quickly change the colours. I know we do most of this work in Figma but this is a great tool for quick changes that developers or BA's may need to make. While I do say that we should share with caution - I do think this has the potential to be a really helpful tool.

## Andrew's Thoughts

I spent some time this weekend diving into the world of mixed reality and augmented reality as I wanted to better understand the technology to see how we use it as a potential solution for the products we build in the next 4 or 5 years. While it's not ready for prime time yet - I think it's important to stay up to date with the potential trends and opportunities of the future. If we know where the industry is headed - it can let us prepare for it so when the time comes - we'll be ready.

I wanted to take this moment to encourage each of you to find time each week, even if it's just an hour marked off in your calendars, to just think. Think about your projects, the state of design and the technology and how we could leverage that technology on your projects.

One of our principals is to be willing to push boundaries and we can't meaningfully do that without giving ourselves the time to determine what that means not only to us but to LifeWorks as well. As much as I believe that AR/MR/VR is the future of design and that it's just a matter of time before that's the medium we all work within - I still need to be able to justify the idea from a product/business perspective as client's won't buy something just because "it looks cool". Instead we need to be able to find the right narratives that the technology could support.

For example, AR/MR could help solve problems with privacy, mean less space required for employees, reduced hardware costs and more collaborative work experiences. These are potential reasons as to why AR could be a beneficial solution and not just something that's gimmicky. 

I think you're all full of amazing ideas and potential concepts and I want to make sure that we want to lean into those ideas/concepts rather than shy away them. LifeWorks is a risk-adverse company but that doesn't mean we should be. Instead we should be focused on what production innovation could look like and consistency lean into the riskier ideas. We may not always succeed in selling folks on our riskier vision but that shouldn't stop us from trying.

Have a great week everyone and I can't wait to see what amazing things you come up with next.

Cheers,  
Andrew
