# **Weekly Newsletter Oct 25th - Oct 29th, 2021**

Happy Monday Folks! This will be a little shorter than normal due to time restraints but wanted to get something out after missing the last two weeks.

##  Abstract Notebooks Trial Rollout 

As some of you know - we’ve been trialing Abstract as a potential solution to managing design documentation, review process and decision tracking. The early trial has ended up being well received  with early positive signs and progress. While I expect a bit of growing pain over the next little while as folks learn to add it to their workflows - the benefits will hopefully make it worthwhile.

One feature I’m excited about is decision tracking. It’s one place to keep track of all the decisions made with a feature. This has already been beneficial as we’ve been using it for Navigate and multiple date changes were made over a short span of time. We were able to keep track of the changes in decision, the order the decisions were made and what the final decision ended up settling on. This feature alone will make project handovers and project onboarding substainally easier moving forward.

On Thursday during our weekly call - Abstract will be joining us to provide a full demo and walkthrough how best to use the tool.

## Thursdays Meeting is Mandatory 

Perfect transition! I’d ask everyone make a point to attend the meeting on Thursday. In addition to the Abstract Demo - there will be some news that Jon and I have to share (It’s good news) that we want everyone present for.

If you’ve got other meetings at this time - please let those teams know you’ll either be unable to attend, or at the very worst - that you’ll be late. Ideally though we’d like to keep folks around for the full meeting.

## Glint Survey Time

This is your quarterly reminder that the Glint Surveys are now out. If you are able to find some time to do it - that’d be greatly appreciated. This is for full time employee’s only - so if you’re a contractor… You can disregard this post.

## QBR Presentation on Tuesday

I’ll be presenting the state of the UI/UX Domain during Q3 in the QBR meeting on Tuesday. I’ll be sure to share any feedback or comments that come out the day.

I’ll also make sure to share the presentation with everyone during one of our next team meetings (or I’ll share the deck).

## Timesheets Due this Week

Timesheets are due this week - please make this a priority as with the move to workday starting next week - 1MSI is due to be expired. This means tracking or adding time after Friday may pose to be difficult. If you are unable to access 1MSI - please be sure to send your hours to Melissa Navia. Ideally everyone’s hours will be posted prior to Friday.


## Workday is coming

Workday is set to launch next Monday which brings a whole host of features to everyone. It’ll allow us to manage time off, career progress, expenses, hours and more. You can find the training videos in Panorama(https://msoit.sharepoint.com/sites/Panorama/SitePages/Workday-learning-hub.aspx?xsdata=MDN8MDF8fDc1YmU1ZTNlNGZmZjQwNDM4OTUzY2ZkYzIzMjE4NTg2fDc1NjViNTFjNWU4NzQ4ZWJiYzgwMjUyYjIwYmMxYWRlfDF8MHw2Mzc2OTkwMjE1ODI3MTg4NjB8R29vZHxWR1ZoYlhOVFpXTjFjbWwwZVZObGNuWnBZMlY4ZXlKV0lqb2lNQzR3TGpBd01EQWlMQ0pRSWpvaUlpd2lRVTRpT2lJaUxDSlhWQ0k2TVRKOQ%3D%3D&sdata=ZWwzQVl3TnhVdGFkYlZQelhJL0F1V0NwaGZzeVYzNzltbFVPRm01N1pUOD0%3D&ovuser=7565b51c-5e87-48eb-bc80-252b20bc1ade%2Crcumming%40morneaushepell.com&OR=Teams-HL&CT=1634305368784) for anyone who may have missed some of the webinars.
