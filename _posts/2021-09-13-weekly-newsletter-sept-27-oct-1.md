# **Weekly Newsletter Sept 13th - Sept 17th, 2021**

Happy Tuesday All! I hope you all had a great weekend and I’m sure many of you are looking forward to the Thanksgiving long weekend just around the corner.

##  Welcome Kevin 

While nearly everyone has had a chance to connect with Kevin - I still wanted to take a few moments to acknowledge him joining the team. Kevin is an experienced UI Developer who actually focused on UI and doesn’t just believe Material is the solution to every problem. Kevin has knowledge with some of the latest trends in CSS such as with CSS Variables and Grids.

Kevin will be working on the rebrand efforts in HPS - working on products such as Morningstar Health, Connect, Transform and Manage to ensure the proper LifeWorks branding is executed.

If you haven’t already - please take a moment to welcome to Kevin and make him feel like a part of the team.

## Reviews 

I’ve noticed that our weekly reviews have started to get cancelled again. While I understand that we might not always have something that’s ready for feedback - it’s still good to share and get some feedback. These reviews shouldn’t be considered optional but rather a key part of your week.

It’s in these reviews that you have the opportunity to grow as a designer and improve your products. These reviews can help with high level concepts, such as UX Wireframes or UX Journeys, or can be used to key in on important details that would be overlooked by business, such as spacing or visual content hierarchy.

I know that reviews can be a pain in the butt sometimes because Business is expecting deliverables - and while we are looking for ways to improve the review process for quick turnaround times - one of the best ways to combat business expectations is to review work frequently.

It’s a change in mentality but an important one. Instead of looking review a full page right before a handoff - we should be sharing the components and elements as things get built up. This will allow for more meaningful feedback without worrying about crazy delivery dates. It also helps combat having to do a ton of last minute changes right before handoff.

If you have ideas or suggestions on how to improve this process - feel free to reach out to myself or Tiphaine.

## Timesheets Reminder

Please be sure to submit your time via 1MSI before the end of the month. I know it can be a pain as you all are busy but when we’re able to log time prior to end of the month it creates a lot less work for a wide variety of people, including Mel.

It also causes challenges with generating the monthly reports as all of your hours ends up being considered internal and doesn’t reflect any capital work that may had been done. This can become problematic as it can result in months being shown as significantly over budget. Given that the executive team is already sensitive to the 2021 budget - it can result in needing to justify the costs generated by team.

If you need support or have any questions on what codes to use - please let me know.

## 2022 Project Planning Underway

Finally the budgets for 2022 are starting to gain clarity and with that comes the 2022 capital project roadmap for each LOB. While there isn’t much to report yet - as information becomes available it’ll likely give us an idea of what the year will look like and whether we need to bring on more bodies or introduce new roles.

To those who oversee their groups - I will likely be reaching out to you in the coming weeks to start making capacity plans so we’re ready to hit the ground running come January 2022.

## Andrew's Thoughts

As we transition from summer to fall - if you’re anything like me - you make find your mental health is impacted by this. It’s been another long year where we’ve been in and out of lockdowns and while Summer helped break things up a bit with patios and warmth - you may find yourself thinking “Here we go again” as the weather gets cooler, the days get shorter and we’re spending more time inside.

I am a big believer in transparency and I’ve been pretty open about my own battles with mental health in the past. I’m a big believer in therapy and that when you need it - it can really make a difference. I know it has done so for me in the past and is been helpful recently as well.

With that said - I wanted to remind everyone that one of the perks of LifeWorks is we have access to a lot of great tools. There’s the EAP suite of support which you can find both through the LifeWorks app as well as through http://workhealthlife.com(http://workhealthlife.com) as well as AbilitiCBT which you can find at http://abiliticbt.com/(http://abiliticbt.com/) - both services are free to use.

I don’t want to push this message to often to the point of sounding like a broken record - but I do think it’s important to remind everyone every so often on how these tools are available to us and that they’re free. It’s a great resource to have when you need it.

Anyways - Have a great week and I can’t wait to see what you folks come up with!

Cheers,  
Andrew
